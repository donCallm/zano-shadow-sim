          <1 recent blocks came too slow  -> miners speed up
          =1 on target, or window not yet available (warmup)

        The multiplier ACCUMULATES, exactly as real difficulty does
        (D_new = D_old * expected/observed), applied once per BLOCK HEIGHT:

            for each new height h:
                m <- m * ((WINDOW*TARGET) / (ts[h] - ts[h-WINDOW])) ** GAIN

        Three properties, each of which cost a failed validation run to
        learn:

        1. ACCUMULATION. A stateless estimator (m = expected/observed each
           call) under-corrects by exactly a square root: with S = T*m/H and
           m = T/S the fixed point is S = T/sqrt(H). Measured at 3x
           hashrate: 78s vs the predicted 120/sqrt(3) = 69s; a 20% minority
           settled at 314s vs 268s. Accumulating makes observed == expected
           the only fixed point.

        2. GAIN = 1/WINDOW. A windowed measurement applied every step
           over-corrects by ~the window length. Gain 0.3 with a 30-block
           window (effective ~9) rang between both safety bounds and left
           the chain 39% slow. 1/window puts the effective gain at 1.

        3. REPLAY PER HEIGHT, not per own-block. Miners mine at different
           rates, so per-own-block updates would apply different numbers of
           corrections per window and drift apart. Replaying over heights
           makes m a pure function of the chain: every miner computes the
           same value, which is what keeps real difficulty coherent.

        This is LWMA's principle (observed vs expected elapsed time) computed
        directly from headers, deliberately NOT from chain difficulty — see
        the block comment in _calculate_next_block_time for why that signal
        was unusable. Reads fresh every call: a cache here would add phase
        lag, which is what makes this class of loop oscillate.

        Timestamps are per-CHAIN, so a partitioned minority retargets on its
        own chain independently — the behavior the no-feedback model lacked.

        Calculate time until next block discovery using Poisson distribution.

        Uses difficulty-only mode for timing adjustment:
        - Base timing assumes hashrate weights sum to 100 at simulation start
        - Difficulty factor scales timing based on LWMA adjustments
        - No hashrate discovery in timing (avoids double-counting)

        Formula: T = -ln(1 - U) / λ
        Where:
            - U is a uniform random number [0, 1)

        # block-header timestamps — the same principle as LWMA, but it does
        # NOT read chain difficulty. History: pacing used to scale by
        # (chain difficulty / baseline), which was unstable and produced
        # 38-minute stalls on seed 8. The instability was not inherent to
        # feedback (real Monero's DAA is exactly this shape and is stable) —
        # it came from four defects in that specific signal, all removed here:
        #   * regtest difficulty is a SMALL INTEGER (1,2,3..22): stepping
        #     1->2 is an instant 2x rate change. Here the correction is a
        #     continuous float.
        #   * the retarget window at genesis is ~3 blocks, so warmup noise
        #     was treated as signal. Here the estimator is silent until a
        #     full window exists (and with a fixed cohort summing to 100 the
        #     uncorrected rate is already correct during warmup).
        #   * the difficulty read was CACHED for 30s, adding phase lag —
        #     the classic oscillation ingredient. This reads fresh headers.
        #   * baseline=1 vs the loop's difficulty-2 equilibrium made every
        #     historical run pace at ~2.8 min/block instead of 2.0.
        #
        # Estimator: over the last DAA_WINDOW blocks, multiplier =
        # (expected elapsed) / (actual elapsed). Blocks too fast => >1 =>
        # miners wait longer. Every miner on a chain reads the same headers,
        # so the correction is coherent across the cohort without consensus
        # difficulty being involved; a partitioned minority retargets on its
        # OWN chain, which is the behavior real Monero has and the previous
